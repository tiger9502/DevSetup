## Installing Proxmox
### Hardware overview
We start with the OpenWRT router we have already set up as the network gateway and router. This setup allows us to get internet access by tethering to the cellular network via 5G.

The Proxmox virtualization environment will be installed on a mini computer. In 2024, this is a CWWK 4 net-port NAS server with N100 processor and 16GB of ram. It has a four NVME SSD array intended for a RAID-10 setup, offering a reliable data storage of 2TB.

Additionally, the Proxmox VE will be installed on a system drive of 256GB capacity.
